Get paid to be in a think tank style job?   Well you can now own a company that allows you to do just that. But it’s not a job.  It’s your actual business to do this.     Why am I selling?    I deal in Private Wealth as well as run multiple other companies (None that Conflict with this). I took a Break with this Company in 2020.   I am not hard up for cash and am more or so looking for just a quick, easy, simple sale. Hassle free. I need to shift my main focus back to 1 brand that is blowing up extremely rapidly, as well as shift almost all my focus back to Private Wealth and my clients, as that is an industry that has no remorse for slacking, “half in-half out”, and needs my undivided attention.  This is just a great opportunity for someone or “someones”.    What is the Business?  A Full-Service Crowdfunding Business Agency (Home Based) with a killer brand name, and by far… one of the Most Well Developed and Creative agencies within the industry. I am more than happy to speak with anyone via Phone, Skype, Zoom ect…  This Business is 100% unique, over 4 Years Old, took me around 1 year and many sleepless nights to create and comes with a tremendous amount of valuable assets in addition.     You meet new people, get to play with awesome inventions, deal with real products, prototypes and help bring someones idea to life and bring it into the world marketplace.

At the beginning, I did everything.  But over the years after learning the industry the Services are all 100% outsourced and 85% of the Crowdfunding services are all Outsourced.    THERE ARE TWO MAJOR EXTRAS  1: In addition to getting paid for the Crowdfunding campaign, many of the client will give you Equity in their business or product. This is huge.   This grows your portfolio and it also can give you nice residual, or even if the product (or whatever it is) blows up, you could just be set for life, or be offered a buyout.    2: I have collaborated this month with a few owners of some major crowdfunding agencies and we traded assets. I traded them some major outsources and they traded me leads.  I now have over 1,600+ DIRECT LEADS for people who want to get their crowdfunding project off the ground and are looking for a company they can use.    The Crowdfunding Industry is at an All Time High. 2021/2022 hit a record-breaking number for crowdfunding and the industry has never been this full before. The projections for 2023 is to surpass 2022 by far. The opportunity is unreal."

Leading Online Clothing Retailer for 20+ Years,"Exton, PA ","$550,000 ","Cash Flow: $224,000","In 1999, after purchasing a Harley Davison American made motorcycle, I realized the Harley branded jackets were made overseas. A relative mentioned his motorcycle jacket was made in USA – Schott NYC Perfecto. Their Perfecto Brand was ‘legendary’ – a coveted biker jacket worn by celebrities and musicians.  I decided to contact Schott to become an online retailer, however the internet was still in its infancy and Schott corporate did not believe in the concept – even though they had several brick-and-mortar retailers with websites.  After directly contacting their local commissioned salesperson, in late 2000 I was able to open an account with $1100 in merchandise. Within two years we became their top e-commerce retailer. After recognizing the business opportunity, Schott decided to create their own retail website to directly compete with Legendary USA.    In 2002, we created our own Legendary USA private label, specializing in certified Made in USA apparel. We collaborated with domestic factories (Schott, Excelled, Cooper, Cockpit, Hillside, etc.) and developed leather motorcycle apparel and military jackets.     The Legendary USA website core customers were patriotic military veterans, as well as the traditional Harley Davison enthusiast, looking for Made in USA apparel that was not emblazoned with Harley logos everywhere.     We decided to highlight horsehide jackets which was a popular leather in the 40’s and 50’s. We were able to collaborate with Schott and re-create classic leather motorcycle jacket designs from Buco, Trojan, Hercules and Beck. Our Legendary Black Stallion became our most popular jacket at the time, along with the Trojan Horse, Black Horse, Iron Horse, Thoroughbred, Dominator as well as the Beck 333 and 680 jackets.     We own the USPTO trademark rights to the nostalgic name Beck, a popular retro brand with roots dating back to 1928 when they collaborated with Schott to build the first motorcycle jacket. We have collaborated with Schott once again on releasing horsehide motorcycle jackets and vests with the Beck label (Northeaster / Flying Togs / Beck). https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4808:go73zq.8.4     In 2005, after seeing an interest in our military jacket line, we launched AceJackets.com as an additional website focusing on militaria.  Website was merged with Legendary USA website in early 2021 due to inventory synchronization issues with previous webhost. https://www.acejackets.com/     We have outfitted celebrities such as country music star Toby Keith as well as others. We have also worked with CBS Studios on episodes of Blue Bloods, etc.     We are proud to be the official supplier to the US Navy Blue Angels Flight Demonstration team with our Legendary Hellcat G-1 Flight Jacket since 2010. https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/     We are currently the official leather vest supplier for the Blue Knights Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club since 2007 – the largest law enforcement motorcycle club with over 19,000 members worldwide. https://www.blueknights.org/     We own over 70 website domains for protective and competitive purposes."

"$141,600  Amazon Pet Food & Supplies (Fully Staffed/Run-For-You)","Chicago, IL ","$84,960 ","Cash Flow: $65,136","You can check the screenshots for proof of this month's sales, last 5 months of sales, most recent scheduled payout, as well as one of the warehouses in our logistics network.    This FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon)/FBM (Fulfilled By Merchant) Amazon store is one of the most profitable and sustainably long term e-commerce businesses listed on this site.    This is exactly why we have a strict process for evaluating qualified buyers through our team.    These are upfront disclaimers, so please do not be offended by them. We are just trying to be transparent:    The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.    So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.    We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).    After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront. If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.    Please refrain from calling in. Make sure to fill out all your info first in BBS. We will not reach out to anonymous buyers. We've both built and sold off many of our online businesses over the years, and have a very efficient process for selling businesses (including this one). So please be respectful of our process.    This business comes with multiple managers to run the team and day to day operations.    It comes with a total of 9 staff members, including management, mid level, and low level highly trained operators.    As you can see in the pictures, it is doing $59,000 revenue in 5 months, which projects about $141,600 for the year.     It is averaging a 40% profit margin, which averages out to around $56,640 in projected annual profit.    We've displayed 5 months worth of revenue screenshots in this listing. You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).    The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).    Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.    This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.    The only thing that needs to be added is your information. It will take about 2-5 weeks after purchase (depending on your speed), to transfer all accounts correctly.    After that, this business will run 100% on autopilot, and you will have 24/7 access to view all operations, sales, and profits whenever you'd like on your phone.    This business is buyer ready, and our team is looking forward to speaking with you and answering all your questions, and giving additional details if you're serious.    Please be mindful that we have a lot of interest already, so we need you to follow our processes to complete the acquisition successfully. These processes make it easiest for both the seller (us), and the buyer.    If you're too busy to do due diligence or look over information and reporting correctly, this business is not for you.    If you are just window shopping, this business is not for you.    If you are looking to get an established e-commerce business with a hybrid of online and brick and mortar models that will likely last for several years and produce passive cashflow, and you're ready to move with speed, this is definitely the business for you.    We are looking forward to helping you."
"Successful Amazon Business (Home-based, Location-Independent)","Phoenix, AZ ","$1,900,000 ",,"No prior experience in the field is required of the new owner as the Store is handled by Amazon FBA (they store products, ship to customers, take care of customer service).    This business sells high end, premium own products (beautifully designed own brands and all items are also great as gifts too - it's a turn key model and any gender can take over this store and run it.  Female customers/target market is a great segment of consumers because they make many household purchases decisions.    No need for employees, staff or physical location in this model - all is done online, which means just less headaches than a traditional brick and mortar business.    Time needed to run it, around 2-3 every weekend, sometimes less (mainly to log in to the Amazon store-account for daily check up and to re-order inventory when it goes low). There is also a big upside potential to this brand and the seller will show you during 1 month training how to grow this brand (if you choose to) and double it, triple or even 10x it (all will depend on how much time you would want to put into growth).    It's all right to keep the business for passive income stream and not grow it as well (Amazon FBA does all the logistics).    It's a perfect business for someone who wants to stay at home and work on their laptop or phone or someone who wants something 100% relocatable, travel-friendly and flexible in every way.    Request: when you send me a message via BizQuest please confirm you are a cash buyer (no owner financing or SBA loan is offered), it's a simple cash at closing acquisition that includes inventory and 1 month of training from an expert in the field (priceless in itself).    Amazon and eCommerce industry itself is on the rise as well and growing as the shopping experience is moving online."

Sale Pending: Rustic Mens Watch & Apparel Brand (15 store locations),"Pine, CO ","$80,000 ","Cash Flow: $25,000","Retro-X is a Colorado based rustic men and women's watch and apparel company with steady, consistent cash flow.     The majority of our sales take place in our gift and jewelry store locations located throughout Denver and the mountain cities.     Retro-X requires less than 4 hours of work each month to maintain and generates somewhere between $2,000-3,000 in mostly passive cash flow.     We have not made an attempt to grow the business in the last two years and it still maintains the same cash flow it did years ago.     Could very easily grow into $10,000 in monthly passive cashflow by spending a few months approaching additional gift and jewelry stores and bringing them on as retail distributors.     Our primary customers are out of state tourists looking for a unique gift to take home and remember their time in Colorado. With the never-ending supply of tourists in the mountain towns, Retro-X sees a consistent stream of customers buying up our unique quality products.     Work required to run Retro-X basically requires monthly check-ins with our stores to see what has been sold, dropping off more product as needed, and picking up cash/checks from our store distributors.     We are selling somewhere around 50-100 products a month in our stores."
"Established, Premium Motorsports Artwork Brand - Ecommerce","Dallas, TX ","$425,000 ","Cash Flow: $120,000","Based in Texas and founded in 2010, the Company is a vertically integrated eCommerce business that specializes in unique motorsports and automotive artwork. The Company designs and manufactures high-quality wood products that feature race tracks from series such as F1, IndyCar, IMSA, WEC, and MotoGP.

"Cell Phone, Tablet, & Laptop Repair Business in Need of Marketing Guru","Chicago, IL ","$30,000 ",,"Since 2009 this business has served over 44,000 customers and fixed 88,000 iPhones, iPads, and other devices. And we have an excellent reputation: 5-star rating on Yelp with 324 reviews and over 600 five-star reviews on Google.    I'm 100% serious when I say this: There may be other cell phone repair companies in the world that match our service, but no one does it better.    This business was built on the following ideas:    1) Fast service. Most repairs are done in 30 minutes or less.  2) Making the process convenient and simple.  3) Friendly & pleasant experience.  4) An affordable price with a lifetime guarantee.    We were also one of the first cell phone repair companies in Chicago. This helped us build a great online presence (do a Google search for ""Chicago iPhone Repair"" and you will see us listed very highly).    What Are You Buying?    - 2 fully trained repair technicians.  - The contact information for most of those 44,000 customers.  - A fully vetted & reliable supply chain.  - An excellent location (in the Chicago Loop).  - All our inventory, repair equipment & supplies, and all other hard assets.  - A great digital and SEO presence.    Why sell?    The business owner has spent the past two years heavily focused on another business and this business has seen a serious lack of marketing. The result has been a significant loss of revenue over the past 12-18 months.     No sugar coating it: This business needs a much more active owner that is capable of marketing an otherwise fantastic business.    Who is the right buyer for this business?    As mentioned above, this is probably the best repair business in the country but not enough people know about that. That leaves two great types of buyers for this business.    First is someone in an adjacent business. For example, if you run a Chicago based telecom or an IT consulting company, this would be an additional service your existing customer base would find compelling AND it could be an excellent source of lead generation since some of our customers are coming in to fix a company provided phone.    Another great purchaser is someone with serious marketing skills. You could build an amazing marketing campaign around our great reputation and years of Chicago service to grow awareness and the customer base. There is also a great opportunity to market to the businesses and apartment buildings in the Chicago Loop. Building these relationships could generate $100,000's of increased annual revenue."

Profitable Software/Marketplace Online Ordering for Restaurants,Virginia ,"$650,000 ",,"A Shopify for Restaurants, established, profitable SaaS (software as a service) marketplace ordering platform that provides a website/online ordering to restaurants to lower ordering costs from the big portals (grubhub / doordash etc.) who charge 20/30% per order.  This business is built with multiple revenue streams in mind. This is a 100% virtual/remote business that can be run from anywhere with no inventory, location needed.    Business revenue is very stable (from existing customers) even though no active marketing in place. Churn is very low as well & we have customers with us for more than 7/8 years. Many things are automated & business requires about 10 hours a week to manage in current state although investing more time will significantly improve/grow things. Restaurant owners have admin access that allows them to make updates/changes to their own website without much need from us. Additionally use a remote agent to help answer tickets. So for the most part everything is automated & require very little time to maintain.    There are numerous other growth opportunities available and I can discuss with the new owner.  The growth opportunity exists both in increasing the overall customers and internally growing the customer value of existing customers. There is also a constant demand for new features that would be very profitable and increase the overall pricing of the software."

Teal Meal started in November 2020. It was created with parents in mind to offer simple, high-quality, eco-friendly products that felt good to use. Additionally, the biggest differentiator of Teal Meal is the mission behind it which serves as a strong foundation of what this business stands for.     Although a young brand in the market, Teal Meal started to get recognized early on by the incredible opportunity to be scouted and featured by the largest television show and broadcast in the United States, Good Morning America on ABC.     It was an experience that helped amplify the voice of Teal Meal by being shown in front of millions of viewers, as well as it helped us create incredible connections with which we have the best relationships that can be used again in the near future. Along with the forementioned, Teal Meal was also featured by a local news channel in Brooklyn, New York – News12, and won the Good Housekeeping's 2022 Parenting Awards, a magazine with over 17 million readers.     Apart from this, different influencers that have a large platform on social media have also loved and shared our products with their audience (influencers ranging from an Instagram follower count from 150,000 up to 3,400,000 with a high engagement rate).     Teal Meal is a trademarked business in the US.    Being eco-friendly and sustainable is the focus today for every parent and this trend will continue to grow as we become more aware of the impact our consumer behavior has. Teal Meal is at the forefront of this incredible mission, and there is so much more potential that this business has to continue to grow and to consolidate its position in the baby niche market.     With the right new management, having all the structures needed to succeed, and continuing to enforce the mission for which the parents are trusting the brand, it will certainly reach and exceed its potential."

"$602,500 Amazon Household Furniture Brand (Fully Staffed/Run-For-You)","Los Angeles, CA ","$382,287 ","Cash Flow: $254,857","This FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon)/FBM (Fulfilled By Merchant) Amazon store is one of the most profitable and sustainably long term e-commerce businesses listed on this site.    This is exactly why we have a strict process for evaluating qualified buyers through our team.    We want to make sure we are only speaking to serious buyers.    The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.    So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.    We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).    After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront. If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    If you don't have time to review the basic information when we send it to you, please don't apply.    After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.    Please refrain from calling in. Make sure to fill out all your info first in BBS. We will not reach out to anonymous buyers. We've both built and sold off many of our online businesses over the years, and have a very efficient process for selling businesses (including this one). So please be respectful of our process.    This business comes with multiple managers to run the team and day to day operations.    It comes with a total of 15 staff members, including management, mid level, and low level highly trained operators.    As you can see in the pictures, it is doing $602,500 in annual revenue, which averages out to about $50,208 monthly revenue, and about $12,552 weekly revenue.    It is averaging a 42.3% profit margin, which averages out to around $254,857.50 annual profit, around $21,238.13 monthly profit, and around $5,309.53 weekly profit.    We've displayed 1 years worth of revenue screenshots in this listing. You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).    The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).    Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.    This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.    The only thing that needs to be added is your information. It will take about 2-5 weeks after purchase (depending on your speed), to transfer all accounts correctly.    After that, this business will run 100% on autopilot, and you will have 24/7 access to view all operations, sales, and profits whenever you'd like on your phone.    This business is buyer ready, and our team is looking forward to speaking with you and answering all your questions, and giving additional details if you're serious.    Please be mindful that we have a lot of interest already, so we need you to follow our processes to complete the acquisition successfully. These processes make it easiest for both the seller (us), and the buyer.    If you're too busy to do due diligence or look over information and reporting correctly, this business is not for you.    If you are just window shopping, this business is not for you.    If you are looking to get an established e-commerce business with a hybrid of online and brick and mortar models that will likely last for several years and produce passive cashflow, and you're ready to move with speed, this is definitely the business for you.    We are looking forward to helping you."
