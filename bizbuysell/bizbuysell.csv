"Well established video recording company, low time commitment","Hayden, ID ","$863,500 "," $150,000","DigiVision is a full service video production company, content producer, and online video platform with a loyal customer base.     The owner can work from anywhere, take travel opportunities, create his own schedule, and take time off for family and adventure.    DigiVision makes money with a high income-to-time ratio. The owner has successfully kept this business producing income for himself despite the 2020 shut downs and the stay at home precautions.    This is a very unique opportunity. DigiVision is a true gem that any entrepreneur would be proud to own. As owner of DigiVision, I've been able to give myself a handsome living. I average about 25 hours a week, taking off large breaks at a time. I've even taken a month or two off at a time. I've also been able to explore many of the great cities around the world.    So what is DigiVision? DigiVision is a full service video production company. It is a content producer, an online video platform, and a library of thousands of like-videos that consumers are willing to pay a premium for.    What does DigiVision do? We specialize in recording conference lectures and presentations and distributing the content to the public. We travel to conferences, we video capture the presentations, then edit and produce them into end-user formats, and finally we distribute the content via our online platform and physical media.    What does this mean for you as a prospective owner? You would need to learn about video capture, which includes running a typical prosumer grade camcorder. You would need to learn about typical conferencing Audio/Visual. You would need to learn about basic one-on-one sales, client management, and web marketing. You would need to learn a little about website administration. All of these items can also be contracted out, which I have done at times.    The current owner is committed to the continued success of DigiVision Media. I will familiarize the new owner with day-to-day operations, make introductions to existing clients, and negotiate for further assistance should the new owner need it.    Company history: It's been my pleasure to own and operate DigiVision since 2006, taking it from my father who started it in 1972. He made his first client from my grandfather's annual medical conference, lugging his reel-to-reel machines three states over to put the conference lectures on audio cassette, the newest consumer technology at the time. I came on shortly after high school, not knowing anything, but eventually took DigiVision from audio CDs to a full blown online web video platform. The last ten years I have focused on improving and automating internal processes, trimming expenses, and freeing up time. This has what has made the income-to-time ratio so high.    Why I'm selling? I think I've reached my full growth potential with DigiVision. I'm seeking adventures that involve building things with my hands, working outdoors, and property ownership and hospitality. Part of me feels so personally connected to DigiVision, but I know it's time to let her go.    I want to be completely upfront. Before COVID, gross revenues were in the $200K to $250K range, with about $80K spent on owner pay and benefits. We have had a couple of big years in the upper 300s and even low 400s. COVID did hit hard in 2020, taking the gross revenue to about $100K, but the company overhead is so low that the personal effect on the owner was minimal. I only reduced my personal take about 10%. 2021 was a little worse on sales, but better on profits; I trimmed a lot of fat. Now, with all restrictions lifted, old and new clients are clamoring for DigiVision's services. Sales in 2022 will be about $125K without any effort made to acquire new clients. Slight effort in networking and sales can put this back to the $200K it was. Going for it full time, hiring a few people, etc, could make 2023 much bigger. It all depends your goals. Owning DigiVision offers you the option to set those goals for yourself."

FBA Store For Sale (~$550k Cash Flow),"Austin, KS ","$1,500,000 "," $548,552","This store is currently doing over $3.2m a year in revenue with ~ 20% margin on sales. I started this store in 2017 and managed the entire business by myself.     From 2017-2020, I only did around $1m in overall gross sales with the average margin on sales being 7%. To be honest it was taking all of my time and I really had no life until I came across a company that manages everything from A-Z.    They do take a % of the net profit but don’t charge any recurring agency fee. The % of the net profit they take is 40% but it was well with it as they have saved me a bunch of time and money. Like I said my store did $1m in gross sales across 3 years which comes down to ~$330k per year.     Since they have taken over they have literally 10xed my gross sales and doubled my margin on sales without me doing any of the work. Although they do take a profit split, my profit has increased tremendously without needing me to do any of the day to day operations.    Right now the reason I’m trying to sell is because the ecommerce store multiple is around 3x (ebida) and with the massive popularity with rollup mergers it just makes sense to sell now.    I haven’t had to get…  -A warehouse  -hire anyone  -find more suppliers   -deal with ordering products    And everything else that goes into running a store, since the management company deals with everything. You don’t need any e-commerce experience or any experience at all.   The management will handle the following responsibilities:  1.) All customer service  2.) All returns/refunds  3.) All prep.

Attached PDF Explains Business in More Detail - Interested Parties Please Read    Have you ever wanted to work with inventions? Meet clever minds around the world?   Get paid to do so? Get paid to be in a think tank style job?   Well you can now own a company that allows you to do just that. But it’s not a job.  It’s your actual business to do this.     Why am I selling?    I deal in Private Wealth as well as run multiple other companies (None that Conflict with this). I took a Break with this Company in 2020.   I am not hard up for cash and am more or so looking for just a quick, easy, simple sale. Hassle free. I need to shift my main focus back to 1 brand that is blowing up extremely rapidly, as well as shift almost all my focus back to Private Wealth and my clients, as that is an industry that has no remorse for slacking, “half in-half out”, and needs my undivided attention.  This is just a great opportunity for someone or “someones”.    What is the Business?  A Full-Service Crowdfunding Business Agency (Home Based) with a killer brand name, and by far… one of the Most Well Developed and Creative agencies within the industry. I am more than happy to speak with anyone via Phone, Skype, Zoom ect…  This Business is 100% unique, over 4 Years Old, took me around 1 year and many sleepless nights to create and comes with a tremendous amount of valuable assets in addition.     You meet new people, get to play with awesome inventions, deal with real products, prototypes and help bring someones idea to life and bring it into the world marketplace.    In addition, the money is great.

At the beginning, I did everything.  But over the years after learning the industry the Services are all 100% outsourced and 85% of the Crowdfunding services are all Outsourced.    THERE ARE TWO MAJOR EXTRAS  1: In addition to getting paid for the Crowdfunding campaign, many of the client will give you Equity in their business or product. This is huge.   This grows your portfolio and it also can give you nice residual, or even if the product (or whatever it is) blows up, you could just be set for life, or be offered a buyout.    2: I have collaborated this month with a few owners of some major crowdfunding agencies and we traded assets. I traded them some major outsources and they traded me leads.  I now have over 1,600+ DIRECT LEADS for people who want to get their crowdfunding project off the ground and are looking for a company they can use.    The Crowdfunding Industry is at an All Time High. 2021/2022 hit a record-breaking number for crowdfunding and the industry has never been this full before. The projections for 2023 is to surpass 2022 by far. The opportunity is unreal."

Leading Online Clothing Retailer for 20+ Years,"Exton, PA ","$550,000 "," $224,000","In 1999, after purchasing a Harley Davison American made motorcycle, I realized the Harley branded jackets were made overseas. A relative mentioned his motorcycle jacket was made in USA – Schott NYC Perfecto. Their Perfecto Brand was ‘legendary’ – a coveted biker jacket worn by celebrities and musicians.  I decided to contact Schott to become an online retailer, however the internet was still in its infancy and Schott corporate did not believe in the concept – even though they had several brick-and-mortar retailers with websites.  After directly contacting their local commissioned salesperson, in late 2000 I was able to open an account with $1100 in merchandise. Within two years we became their top e-commerce retailer. After recognizing the business opportunity, Schott decided to create their own retail website to directly compete with Legendary USA.    In 2002, we created our own Legendary USA private label, specializing in certified Made in USA apparel. We collaborated with domestic factories (Schott, Excelled, Cooper, Cockpit, Hillside, etc.) and developed leather motorcycle apparel and military jackets.     The Legendary USA website core customers were patriotic military veterans, as well as the traditional Harley Davison enthusiast, looking for Made in USA apparel that was not emblazoned with Harley logos everywhere.     We decided to highlight horsehide jackets which was a popular leather in the 40’s and 50’s. We were able to collaborate with Schott and re-create classic leather motorcycle jacket designs from Buco, Trojan, Hercules and Beck. Our Legendary Black Stallion became our most popular jacket at the time, along with the Trojan Horse, Black Horse, Iron Horse, Thoroughbred, Dominator as well as the Beck 333 and 680 jackets.     We own the USPTO trademark rights to the nostalgic name Beck, a popular retro brand with roots dating back to 1928 when they collaborated with Schott to build the first motorcycle jacket. We have collaborated with Schott once again on releasing horsehide motorcycle jackets and vests with the Beck label (Northeaster / Flying Togs / Beck). https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4808:go73zq.8.4     In 2005, after seeing an interest in our military jacket line, we launched AceJackets.com as an additional website focusing on militaria.  Website was merged with Legendary USA website in early 2021 due to inventory synchronization issues with previous webhost. https://www.acejackets.com/     We have outfitted celebrities such as country music star Toby Keith as well as others. We have also worked with CBS Studios on episodes of Blue Bloods, etc.     We are proud to be the official supplier to the US Navy Blue Angels Flight Demonstration team with our Legendary Hellcat G-1 Flight Jacket since 2010. https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/     We are currently the official leather vest supplier for the Blue Knights Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club since 2007 – the largest law enforcement motorcycle club with over 19,000 members worldwide. https://www.blueknights.org/     We own over 70 website domains for protective and competitive purposes."

This FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon)/FBM (Fulfilled By Merchant) Amazon store is one of the most profitable and sustainably long term e-commerce businesses listed on this site.    This is exactly why we have a strict process for evaluating qualified buyers through our team.    These are upfront disclaimers, so please do not be offended by them. We are just trying to be transparent:    The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.    So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.    We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).    After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront. If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.    Please refrain from calling in. Make sure to fill out all your info first in BBS. We will not reach out to anonymous buyers. We've both built and sold off many of our online businesses over the years, and have a very efficient process for selling businesses (including this one). So please be respectful of our process.    This business comes with multiple managers to run the team and day to day operations.    It comes with a total of 9 staff members, including management, mid level, and low level highly trained operators.    As you can see in the pictures, it is doing $59,000 revenue in 5 months, which projects about $141,600 for the year.     It is averaging a 40% profit margin, which averages out to around $56,640 in projected annual profit.    We've displayed 5 months worth of revenue screenshots in this listing. You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).    The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).    Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.    This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.    The only thing that needs to be added is your information. It will take about 2-5 weeks after purchase (depending on your speed), to transfer all accounts correctly.    After that, this business will run 100% on autopilot, and you will have 24/7 access to view all operations, sales, and profits whenever you'd like on your phone.    This business is buyer ready, and our team is looking forward to speaking with you and answering all your questions, and giving additional details if you're serious.    Please be mindful that we have a lot of interest already, so we need you to follow our processes to complete the acquisition successfully. These processes make it easiest for both the seller (us), and the buyer.    If you're too busy to do due diligence or look over information and reporting correctly, this business is not for you.    If you are just window shopping, this business is not for you.    If you are looking to get an established e-commerce business with a hybrid of online and brick and mortar models that will likely last for several years and produce passive cashflow, and you're ready to move with speed, this is definitely the business for you.

"Successful Amazon Business (Home-based, Location-Independent)","Phoenix, AZ","$1,900,000",n/a,"No prior experience in the field is required of the new owner as the Store is handled by Amazon FBA (they store products, ship to customers, take care of customer service).    This business sells high end, premium own products (beautifully designed own brands and all items are also great as gifts too - it's a turn key model and any gender can take over this store and run it.  Female customers/target market is a great segment of consumers because they make many household purchases decisions.    No need for employees, staff or physical location in this model - all is done online, which means just less headaches than a traditional brick and mortar business.    Time needed to run it, around 2-3 every weekend, sometimes less (mainly to log in to the Amazon store-account for daily check up and to re-order inventory when it goes low). There is also a big upside potential to this brand and the seller will show you during 1 month training how to grow this brand (if you choose to) and double it, triple or even 10x it (all will depend on how much time you would want to put into growth).    It's all right to keep the business for passive income stream and not grow it as well (Amazon FBA does all the logistics).    It's a perfect business for someone who wants to stay at home and work on their laptop or phone or someone who wants something 100% relocatable, travel-friendly and flexible in every way.    Request: when you send me a message via BizQuest please confirm you are a cash buyer (no owner financing or SBA loan is offered), it's a simple cash at closing acquisition that includes inventory and 1 month of training from an expert in the field (priceless in itself).    Amazon and eCommerce industry itself is on the rise as well and growing as the shopping experience is moving online."
Sale Pending: Rustic Mens Watch & Apparel Brand (15 store locations),"Pine, CO ","$80,000 "," $25,000","Retro-X is a Colorado based rustic men and women's watch and apparel company with steady, consistent cash flow.     The majority of our sales take place in our gift and jewelry store locations located throughout Denver and the mountain cities.     Retro-X requires less than 4 hours of work each month to maintain and generates somewhere between $2,000-3,000 in mostly passive cash flow.     We have not made an attempt to grow the business in the last two years and it still maintains the same cash flow it did years ago.     Could very easily grow into $10,000 in monthly passive cashflow by spending a few months approaching additional gift and jewelry stores and bringing them on as retail distributors.     Our primary customers are out of state tourists looking for a unique gift to take home and remember their time in Colorado. With the never-ending supply of tourists in the mountain towns, Retro-X sees a consistent stream of customers buying up our unique quality products.     Work required to run Retro-X basically requires monthly check-ins with our stores to see what has been sold, dropping off more product as needed, and picking up cash/checks from our store distributors.     We are selling somewhere around 50-100 products a month in our stores."

"Cell Phone, Tablet, & Laptop Repair Business in Need of Marketing Guru","Chicago, IL","$30,000",n/a,"Since 2009 this business has served over 44,000 customers and fixed 88,000 iPhones, iPads, and other devices. And we have an excellent reputation: 5-star rating on Yelp with 324 reviews and over 600 five-star reviews on Google.    I'm 100% serious when I say this: There may be other cell phone repair companies in the world that match our service, but no one does it better.    This business was built on the following ideas:    1) Fast service. Most repairs are done in 30 minutes or less.  2) Making the process convenient and simple.  3) Friendly & pleasant experience.  4) An affordable price with a lifetime guarantee.    We were also one of the first cell phone repair companies in Chicago. This helped us build a great online presence (do a Google search for ""Chicago iPhone Repair"" and you will see us listed very highly).    What Are You Buying?    - 2 fully trained repair technicians.  - The contact information for most of those 44,000 customers.  - A fully vetted & reliable supply chain.  - An excellent location (in the Chicago Loop).  - All our inventory, repair equipment & supplies, and all other hard assets.  - A great digital and SEO presence.    Why sell?    The business owner has spent the past two years heavily focused on another business and this business has seen a serious lack of marketing. The result has been a significant loss of revenue over the past 12-18 months.     No sugar coating it: This business needs a much more active owner that is capable of marketing an otherwise fantastic business.    Who is the right buyer for this business?    As mentioned above, this is probably the best repair business in the country but not enough people know about that. That leaves two great types of buyers for this business.    First is someone in an adjacent business. For example, if you run a Chicago based telecom or an IT consulting company, this would be an additional service your existing customer base would find compelling AND it could be an excellent source of lead generation since some of our customers are coming in to fix a company provided phone.    Another great purchaser is someone with serious marketing skills. You could build an amazing marketing campaign around our great reputation and years of Chicago service to grow awareness and the customer base. There is also a great opportunity to market to the businesses and apartment buildings in the Chicago Loop. Building these relationships could generate $100,000's of increased annual revenue."
Profitable Software/Marketplace Online Ordering for Restaurants,Virginia,"$650,000",n/a,"A Shopify for Restaurants, established, profitable SaaS (software as a service) marketplace ordering platform that provides a website/online ordering to restaurants to lower ordering costs from the big portals (grubhub / doordash etc.) who charge 20/30% per order.  This business is built with multiple revenue streams in mind. This is a 100% virtual/remote business that can be run from anywhere with no inventory, location needed.    Business revenue is very stable (from existing customers) even though no active marketing in place. Churn is very low as well & we have customers with us for more than 7/8 years. Many things are automated & business requires about 10 hours a week to manage in current state although investing more time will significantly improve/grow things. Restaurant owners have admin access that allows them to make updates/changes to their own website without much need from us. Additionally use a remote agent to help answer tickets. So for the most part everything is automated & require very little time to maintain.    There are numerous other growth opportunities available and I can discuss with the new owner.  The growth opportunity exists both in increasing the overall customers and internally growing the customer value of existing customers. There is also a constant demand for new features that would be very profitable and increase the overall pricing of the software."

It was created with parents in mind to offer simple, high-quality, eco-friendly products that felt good to use. Additionally, the biggest differentiator of Teal Meal is the mission behind it which serves as a strong foundation of what this business stands for.     Although a young brand in the market, Teal Meal started to get recognized early on by the incredible opportunity to be scouted and featured by the largest television show and broadcast in the United States, Good Morning America on ABC.     It was an experience that helped amplify the voice of Teal Meal by being shown in front of millions of viewers, as well as it helped us create incredible connections with which we have the best relationships that can be used again in the near future. Along with the forementioned, Teal Meal was also featured by a local news channel in Brooklyn, New York – News12, and won the Good Housekeeping's 2022 Parenting Awards, a magazine with over 17 million readers.     Apart from this, different influencers that have a large platform on social media have also loved and shared our products with their audience (influencers ranging from an Instagram follower count from 150,000 up to 3,400,000 with a high engagement rate).     Teal Meal is a trademarked business in the US.    Being eco-friendly and sustainable is the focus today for every parent and this trend will continue to grow as we become more aware of the impact our consumer behavior has. Teal Meal is at the forefront of this incredible mission, and there is so much more potential that this business has to continue to grow and to consolidate its position in the baby niche market.     With the right new management, having all the structures needed to succeed, and continuing to enforce the mission for which the parents are trusting the brand, it will certainly reach and exceed its potential."

If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    If you don't have time to review the basic information when we send it to you, please don't apply.    After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.

This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.

ESTABLISHED Amazon FBA Store [Inventory Included],"Costa Mesa, CA ","$199,638 "," $78,433","This is a completely turnkey Amazon FBA store that has the building blocks to do $1m + per year.    I started this store back in 2019 with the sole goal of not requiring much of my time. This store only has 17 products, with each of them ranking pretty high (< 25000 BSR) in Amazon’s marketplace. I currently only use ONE supplier who I have worked with from the start. I should also note I paid a company to build this from scratch and set up all the systems and processes and without them I wouldn’t be where I am today.    As of right now I literally only work 2-3 hours per quarter (every 3 months), reordering inventory and reviewing my overall performance. Because I wanted this business to require the least amount of time possible, I made it a priority to only have to order inventory 2-3 times per year.     Don’t get me wrong if you purchase this store, you will have the opportunity to scale this to the next level with the existing relationship I have with that supplier. They literally have made this so easy for me by shipping directly to Amazon’s warehouse, prepping the products and so many other things that go into getting the products ready to sell. They also have a wide range of other products that they have suggested I add to my inventory fleet, but I have decided not to. The reason for that is for me to pay off my student loans and help my family with some bills.    I don’t have a warehouse because I don’t need one. I don’t have any employees because the supplier does 99% of the work. I don’t use any crazy software. I really don’t do anything and this business has consistently grown every single year.    Now you may be asking well why do you want to get rid of it then?    And to be honest, I want to change gears and get into the real estate space. I want to take the money I get from selling this and buy a multifamily building. I’ve always wanted to get into real estate and this is the cash I need in order to do so"

"Established Shopify Clothing Brand For Sale. $145,000 Rev. in 2020",Illinois,"$25,000",n/a,"About the Brand Owner    Hey! My name is Yaswanth. Over the past 6 years, I have built multiple businesses. One of my main businesses was the Phi Concept. A clothing brand that I started in high school with my friends. We have built this business for over 6 years and in 2020, the clothing brand went viral and took off. We started shipping 100s of orders per week. In 2021, my real estate business started exploding and I simply had no time to dedicate to the brand which is why I paused it. Now, I am looking to find a good new owner for the clothing brand.    What You Get:  - ALL Designs, Logos, Graphics  - ALL Intelectual Property  - Fully Built and Operational Shopify Store & Website with Over 900,000 Lifetime Website Vistors  - Domain  - Social Media Accounts (TikTok & Instagram)  - Supplier Relationships  - 1-on-1 Coaching on How to Run the Business: I will coach you one-on-one, once a week for 4 weeks, up to 1.5 hours each meeting. I will provide the relationships, introductions & knowledge to succeed with this business.    Instagram  13,000 followers    Tiktok  21,300 followers    Overview    The Phi Concept is a streetwear brand. We come up with ideas and designs that are close to our hearts and share them with the world through clothing. Our core business is to create fun, unique streetwear items and sell them at good prices!    Why Am I Selling?    I have decided to sell this business because I cannot dedicate as much time as I used to be able to. In 2020, both of my businesses started succeeding at the same time. My real estate company grew exponentially and became very profitable, so I had to spend all my time on the real estate company and did not have any other time left to dedicate to my clothing brand. I have to manage employees and hundreds of customers from the real estate business. I am looking to find a new owner for the business because people still ask how they can buy clothing from us, love and miss the brand. I want them to be able to continue purchasing from the brand and enjoy the designs that the brand creates.    Growth Potential    You will have to create new clothing designs (you can pay a graphic designer to do this), order t-shirts/products from the suppliers, and you will have to ship orders to customers who buy from you. Another important part of the business is marketing. You will have to grow the brand by different ways of marketing like we did such as paid advertising, tiktok, youtube etc.!    Why did I start this company?    I am very passionate about design and clothing. I love creating clothing designs, especially streetwear items like hoodies & graphic tees. In 2016, I started this brand in high school and used to see the t-shirts, and hoodies for kids in my high school for $20 each. Later, we decided to open an eCommerce store and we used Shopify to host it. In 2020, I learned about paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram and our brand went viral and we had record-breaking sales compared to previous years. I started this business because it is a personal passion project and people loved the clothing designs that I had ideas for and worked with designers to turn into a reality.    Responsibilities    You will have to create new clothing designs (you can pay a graphic designer to do this), order t-shirts/products from the suppliers, and you will have to ship orders to customers who buy from you. Another important part of the business is marketing. You will have to grow the brand by different ways of marketing like we did such as paid advertising, tiktok, youtube etc.!    Post-Sale / Acquisition Support    I will coach you one-on-one, once a week for 4 weeks, up to 1.5 hours each meeting. I will provide the relationships, introductions & knowledge to succeed with this business. I will also provide recorded training to you so you can learn about the business and provide a book for you to learn about the clothing brand business."
"$2,302,000 Amazon Health Supplements + Vitamins Brand (Fully Staffed)","Miami, FL ","$1,633,269 "," $1,088,846","This FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon)/FBM (Fulfilled By Merchant) Amazon store is one of the most profitable and sustainably long term e-commerce businesses listed on this site.    This is exactly why we have a strict process for evaluating qualified buyers through our team.    We want to make sure we are only speaking to serious buyers.    The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.    So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.    We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).    After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront. If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    If you don't have time to review the basic information when we send it to you, please don't apply.    After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.    Please refrain from calling in. Make sure to fill out all your info first in BBS. We will not reach out to anonymous buyers. We've both built and sold off many of our online businesses over the years, and have a very efficient process for selling businesses (including this one). So please be respectful of our process.    This business comes with multiple managers to run the team and day to day operations.    It comes with a total of 13 staff members, including management, mid level, and low level highly trained operators.    As you can see in the pictures, it is doing $2,302,000 in annual revenue, which averages out to about $191,833 monthly revenue, and about $47,958 weekly revenue.    It is averaging a 43.7% profit margin, which averages out to around $1,088,846 annual profit, around $90,737 monthly profit, and around $22,684 weekly profit.    We've displayed 1 years worth of revenue screenshots in this listing. You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).    The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).    Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.    This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.    The only thing that needs to be added is your information. It will take about 2-5 weeks after purchase (depending on your speed), to transfer all accounts correctly.    After that, this business will run 100% on autopilot, and you will have 24/7 access to view all operations, sales, and profits whenever you'd like on your phone.    This business is buyer ready, and our team is looking forward to speaking with you and answering all your questions, and giving additional details if you're serious.    Please be mindful that we have a lot of interest already, so we need you to follow our processes to complete the acquisition successfully. These processes make it easiest for both the seller (us), and the buyer.    If you're too busy to do due diligence or look over information and reporting correctly, this business is not for you.    If you are just window shopping, this business is not for you.    If you are looking to get an established e-commerce business with a hybrid of online and brick and mortar models that will likely last for several years and produce passive cashflow, and you're ready to move with speed, this is definitely the business for you.    We are looking forward to helping you."

7 Figure Amazon FBA Store (HANDS-FREE),"Lexington, MA ","$1,799,999 "," $696,035","Let me guess….    If you are on this page you're most likely a high valued entrepreneur looking to acquire a few cash flow producing businesses with the extremely low interest rates (AKA SBA Loans).    Because of that, I’m going to keep this extremely short in hopes that you book a call (where we will go in depth on everything about the store for sale).    To keep this short I want to briefly go over 3 key parts of our strategy.    Our Data + Ai  Why Amazon  Exit    We have acquired/bought decades of ecommerce data that we flush through our custom built AI and machine learning software (built by a data scientist). We use the data to compare against 26 real life ecommerce variables to make sure we always pick the best producing products.    This also enables us to always have our money working at its best ability (aka opportunity cost) at all times.    Which leads me into my next point, which is why AMAZON?    And besides the facts that everyone knows, (biggest ecom retailer, massive growth, biggest company in the united states) Amazon is a massive target market for VC firms looking to get a piece of the pie.    You see these VC firms are leveraging a strategy called “Roll Up Merger”, which is when a VC firm raises capital (100’s of millions) and deploys that capital to acquire as many businesses as possible.    In this case they acquire Amazon FBA stores, merge to one company, then take the company public through an IPO to recoup all their money and some.    And this is the exact reason why we have spent all of our time mastering the game of building, scaling and exiting Amazon FBA stores.    You see the store’s ad, Your viewing right now was a silent partner of ours that wants to sell their store.     We legit built, managed, scaled and prepped this store to be acquired all on the behalf of one of our clients.    If you want to purchase an existing store or have us build one from the ground up, then click the link below to book a call.      When you book you will be sent our white-paper, road map and a few other useful information about the store for sale.    The gross revenues and cash flow is based on the last 3 years of sales from (2018-2021). The sale price will include the $332,950 in inventory that's left over."

Turnkey/Hands-Free Fully Operational Amazon Store,"Chino, CA ","$395,000 "," $250,000","FBA is hands-down the most sustainable way of selling on Amazon. Combined with the evergreen products listed for sale and the hybrid model of Wholesale & Private label products, this model is one of the best (if not the best) e-commerce model.     Let me start by saying this store is run by a management company who does all of the work on your behalf, for a portion of the profits. They will source new products, handle all the customer service, provide P&L accounting statements and do ALL the work involved with running this business. This store also leverages all of their software's that they have built over the past decade.     The Hybrid model of Wholesale & Private label products creates diversification and therefor lowers the risk drastically as opposed to niching down in a specific market/product. The management company also pays the salaries of the employees working on this store out of their cut of the profits.     The numbers behind this business:   -Avg ROI on sales - 25-50%  -Little to no competition (for the specific products we sell)   - 2021 Top Line sales - $923,583     Reason for selling? I'd like to start another store for my wife and kids and the capital from this sale would allow me to open 2 stores and start from scratch.     Time spent on this business?

"$2,300,000 Amazon Home Lighting + Lamps Brand (Fully Staffed)","New York, NY ","$1,456,812 "," $971,208","This FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon)/FBM (Fulfilled By Merchant) Amazon store is likely the most profitable and reliable long term e-commerce business listed on this site.     Therefore, we have a strict process for evaluating qualified buyers through our team.     We want to make sure we are only speaking to serious buyers.     The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.    So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.    We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).     After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront. If you still think it's a good fit for you, our team will reach out to schedule a call with you.    If you don't have time to review the basic information when we send it to you, please don't apply.     After you review the basic information, Q&A calls with our team will be reserved for specific questions only, which are not covered in this listing or in our specific info which will be emailed to you.     Please refrain from calling in. Make sure to fill out all your info in BBS. We will not reach out to anonymous buyers. We've sold off many of our online businesses over the years, and have a very efficient process for selling businesses (including this one). So please be respectful of our process.     This business comes with multiple managers to run the team and day to day operations.     It comes with a total of 17 staff members, including management, mid level, and low level highly trained operators.     As you can see in the pictures, it is doing $2,296,000 in annual revenue, which averages out to about $191,333 monthly revenue, and about $47,833 weekly revenue.     It is averaging a 42.3% profit margin, which averages out to around $918,400 annual profit, around $76,533 monthly profit, and around $19,133 weekly profit.     We've displayed 1 years worth of revenue screenshots in this listing. You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).     The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).     Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.     This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.     The only thing that needs to be added is your information. It will take about 2-5 weeks after purchase (depending on your speed), to transfer all accounts correctly.     After that, this business will run 100% on autopilot, and you will have 24/7 access to view all operations, sales, and profits whenever you'd like on your phone.     This business is buyer ready, and our team is looking forward to speaking with you and answering all your questions, and giving additional details if you're serious.     Please be mindful that we have a lot of interest already, so we need you to follow our processes to complete the acquisition successfully. These processes make it easiest for both the seller (us), and the buyer.    If you're too busy to do due diligence or look over information and reporting correctly, this business is not for you.     If you are just window shopping, this business is not for you.     If you are looking to get an established e-commerce business with a hybrid of online and brick and mortar models that will likely last for several years and produce passive cashflow, and you're ready to move with speed, this is definitely the business for you.       We are looking forward to helping you."

"Asset Sale - Jewelry, Packaging, Jewelry Displays, Domain and Website","Boulder, CO","$120,000",n/a,"This is an asset sale - not the whole business, but I will close my LLC and you can open it in your own name and have everything you need.   I used to own a jewelry shop in Boulder, CO, but closed it right before the pandemic and got a regular job. I have kept up the website but I did not invest any time nor money into promoting the website. The website name is www.nadima.com - feel free to explore and get a sense of what type of jewelry it is. I have acquired all jewelry myself by attending multiple international trade shows - my suppliers are from India, China, US, Canada and Poland. I mostly have sterling silver jewelry with natural gemstones (topaz, citrine, garnet, chalcedony, rhodochrosite, rose quartz, sapphire, ruby, amethyst, etc.) and some in gold with emerald, diamonds, sapphire and ruby.   The inventory (jewelry) alone in wholesale prices worth over $100K. In this sale I will also include high quality jewelry boxes with the company logo - Nadima (I've spent on these approximately $20K). I have a lot of these jewelry boxes: ring boxes, earrings, necklaces and bracelets and soft pouches (without any company logo) - each category 2800 - 3000 pieces. I can also provide to you the list of contacts, suppliers so you can acquire more of the jewelry without traveling far to find trustworthy contacts. I just don't know their current prices.   The website was built on squarespace.com and can be adjusted and modified to your needs and preferences without hiring developers, etc.   So, what am I selling:  1. Jewelry Inventory   2. Jewelry Packaging Boxes  3. Some jewelry displays (only a few hundred maybe)  4. Domain: www.nadima.com  5. Built website on squarespace.com    I recognize that you will need to put some effort and potentially money to promote the website, but besides that - you will have everything you need and I am open to meet and share all the information you would like to know. Our customers loved the shop, and I am a little sad to let this go. However, I am ready for a new chapter in my life (decided to go traveling) and would be happy to see this business succeed in smart and dedicated hands. Let me know if you have any questions, I will do my best to respond as soon as possible! Thank you for looking!"
Crypto Only Social Media Platform,"Bellevue, WA","$150,000",n/a,"Bitcoin Social is one of the worlds first crypto focused social media platform targeting the crypto / blockchain community. Right now most users have to go to other sources such as Reddit, Twitter or Telegram channels to connect with the community. There is no centralized or easy platform for the community to connect and gather information from.  Bitcoin Social is fixing that problem by creating a centralizing application for the community into one space.    The asset comes with a front-end web application, back-end admin portal, and 2 mobile apps (iOS and Android). Currently the platform has over 1,400 members and 3,800 page views daily. This traffic is all organic which also includes 33,000 backlinks with ZERO marketing efforts.     The platform can generate revenue through multiple sources such as advertising (similar to Facebook), selling classified spaces, creating events, Google Adsense, and tying into a NFT marketplace.    Currently the platform is live and has an advertising module (this just went live a few days ago), groups, social feed, classifieds, forums, events, chat, blogs, and much more social functions.    The crypto space is growing at 113% per year in terms of users. Even if it slows down to the 63% growth rate of network adoption the internet saw at the same stage, its going to lead to 4bn users by 2030 or earlier.    The application is built on a power engine and hosted on AWS instances that are fast, reliable, secure, and scalable."
